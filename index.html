    <h2>What is HUNGER? Why is it considered as a GLOBAL problem?</h2>
    <p>Hunger is a state where a person lacks sufficient food for an active and healthy life, 
        leading to malnutrition and health issues. It's considered a global problem because it affects millions worldwide,
         particularly in developing countries, hindering economic growth and social stability. 
         Addressing hunger requires international cooperation and sustainable solutions to ensure food security for all.
         It is a complex issue with interconnected factors like poverty, conflict, and climate change.</p>
